#BEBP

**B**e **E**xcited **B**e **P**repared is a robust communication and community outreach campaign designed to provide the public with as much information as possible about capital improvement projects in the City of Santa Monica. As part of implementing the communityâ€™s vision for the future of Santa Monica, there will be several projects under construction in the next few years. This progress is exciting, but will require patience and preparation to handle potential construction impacts. City staff will work actively with community partners to keep residents, businesses, and visitors up-to-date and engaged on the progress of these projects.
